# Tenseigan

Tenseigan is a tuning framework that can automatically find good settings for a database management system's configuration knobs. Tenseigan is developed based on [OtterTune](https://github.com/cmu-db/ottertune) and added support for the distributed databases. Tenseigan also integrates distributed tuning algorithms, which perform better on distributed databases.

## Supports for the Distributed Databases

- TiDB

## Distributed Tuning Algorithms

- MADDPG
